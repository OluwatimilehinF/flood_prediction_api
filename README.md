Flood Risk Classification API

Machine Learning Model Deployment with FastAPI

**Overview**

This repository contains the implementation of a *Flood Risk Classification Model*, developed to predict the likelihood of flooding in riverine communities using environmental and sensor data.

The model serves as the analytical core of the *Flood Alert System*, complementing IoT hardware by interpreting sensor readings (such as water level, temperature, and humidity) to classify risk levels as Low, Moderate, or High.
